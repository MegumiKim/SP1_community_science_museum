					We also have the <strong>Young Stars club</strong> which meets once a

					and experiment with our team of experts. During the school holidays we
					run <strong>special holiday clubs</strong> where you can join other
					children your age to go on a journey of discovery. Each holiday we
					pick a new theme to explore. To find out more about the holiday club
					and how you can join, send us a message
