You can learn about Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, or why not travel back in time and meet our resident Woolly Mammoth? Our exhibits are designed to be accessible for interested minds, so make sure you come ready to learn and explore.
We also have the <strong>Young Stars club</strong> which meets once a week on a Saturday between 10:00 and 13:00 where you’ll get to explore and experiment with our team of experts.
During the school holidays we run <strong>special holiday clubs</strong> where you can join other children your age to go on a journey of discovery. Each holiday we pick a new theme to explore. To find out more about the holiday club and how you can join, send us a message <a href="contact.html">here</a>.

      <h2>volunteer</h2>
      <p class="p_big">A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the displays in good order and ready for visitors to come and enjoy. 

        Volunteering has its perks including getting to see behind the scenes of a working museum, access to staff-only lectures, and a monthly lunch where all staff and volunteers come together to discuss ideas for future exhibits and strategies for the museum.
        You can help volunteer in a number of different spheres. Please contact us <a href="contact.html">here</a> if you’d like to find out more about how you can get involved.</p>
