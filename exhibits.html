						Cosmology Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic
						exhibition, ‘The Sky Above Us’, explores the night sky and what we
						can see and know about the universe around us.

					<p>
						We’ll locate the various constellations and galaxies that can be
						seen and learn a bit about the early navigators who used the stars
						to travel by.
					</p>

						Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab
						traders, to Galileo’s telescope, to the latest exploration of the

				<p id="p_one">
					For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the

					a few of the creatures who didn’t survive, including our Woolly

				<h2>biology & medicine</h2>
				<p id="bio_p">
					From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology
					are offering us unique insights into the great wonders of the tiny
					world. For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their
					quality of life much improved, thanks to the growth of our
					understanding of medicine.

				<p id="bio_p_two">
					Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of medicine and take
					a look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of
					penicillin and the first heart transplant. Many of our great medicinal
					discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also from observing
					animals in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.
